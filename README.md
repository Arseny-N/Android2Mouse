Android2Mouse
=============

Android2Mouse is a mobile program that allows to remotely control a computer using an ordinary Android smartphone.

The main feature of Android2Mouse is that _it does not require the installation of any special software on the computer being controlled_.  

The interaction is performed through bluetooth specifically through an l2cap connection. The program changes the HID attribute of the mobile device to one matching the attributes of a peripheral device. This allows to leverage already existing functioanlity in the mobile device and removes the need of installing any specialized software on the controlled device. All of the computer mouse functions and most of keyboard and game-pad functions could be performeb by this program.
