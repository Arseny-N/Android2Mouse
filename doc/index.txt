This project turns your phone in a Bluetooth mouse, rather useful - in case
you need to control the mouse pointer remotely.Before installing it you should
consider that it has certain advantages and disadvantages.
Advantages:
    * Don't depend on third-party software installed on the host machine(as
      other projects do).
    * Could be used with any devices that support Bluetooth mouses, in other
      words Linux, Mac, BSD, Windows, it will work equally well with any of
      them.
Disadvantages:
    * You should have root permissions on your phone(it should be rooted).
    * It is moderately difficult to make it to work in some situations(see
      known bugs).
    * It is moderately difficult to install it(see how to install).
Well, if you are still with us then you can proceed to the installation guide.
